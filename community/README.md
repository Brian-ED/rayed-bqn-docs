## Can I help out?

Rayed-bqn welcomes contributors, and there are plenty of ways to help.
One way is just talking about rayed-bqn in the [BQN forums](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/#where-can-i-find-bqn-users), pitching ideas and correcting mistakes, including spelling mistakes! If enough people pitch in, it might be time to make a rayed-bqn discord, but not neccessary yet.

Another way to help is posting issues on github, which works better for organized discussions. I might even add issues myself as a todo list.
